## Zomato Data Analysis
  
  # Problem Statement
- Zomato is facing a decline in customer engagement and  rising order cancellations. Customers are leaving due to  issues such as delayed deliveries, incorrect orders, and poor service.  Cancellations could be caused by unreliable customer support, inaccurate delivery estimates, or restaurant-related problems like unavailable menu items or slow food preparation. These 
issues are affecting user trust and satisfaction, leading to decreased loyalty and higher churn rates.

 #  Goal
- The primary goal is to improve customer retention, satisfaction, and operational efficiency at Zomato by addressing issues related to declining customer engagement, fluctuating delivery times, and inconsistent sales performance across regions. The objective is to use data analysis to uncover actionable insights that enhance service quality, reduce order cancellations, and boost repeat customer rates.
